Iâ€™m Zhihuan Huang, a final-year undergrad at Turing Class, Peking University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Yuqing Kong. I am also pleased to have worked with Tracy Xiao Liu and Grant Schoenebeck during my undergraduate years.

My research interest lies in the intersection of computer science and economics: algorithmic game theory, information elicitation, mechanism design and block chain.

I will study for my PhD under the guidance of Yuqing Kong.
