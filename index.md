            <p>Iâ€™m Zhihuan Huang, a final-year undergrad at Turing Class, Peking University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Yuqing Kong. I am also pleased to have worked with Tracy Xiao Liu and Grant Schoenebeck during my undergraduate years.</p>
            <p>My research interest lies in the intersection of computer science and economics: algorithmic game theory, information elicitation, mechanism design and block chain.</p>
            <p>I will study for my PhD under the guidance of Yuqing Kong.</p>
